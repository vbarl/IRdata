------ README file for the ice particle database ------

This folder contains the single scattering properties of ice particles
from [1] and [2], converted to the ARTS xml format. The data
correspond to various shapes and particle surface roughness, covering
wavelengths between 0.2 and 99 um (the original data come in two parts
(0.2-15.25 um and 16.4-99.0 um), these are here merged).

Please cite, at least, [2] when using these data in publications. 

The data are here stored in the ARTS (v2.4-v2.6) XML format for single
scattering data. See the file xmlload_test.py for a small
demonstration on how to import the data into Python, and how to there
explore the data format.

The scripts that were used to convert Yang et al.'s ascii files to these
ARTS xml format are found at https://github.com/vbarl/IRdata
The conversion of the data was done at Chalmers University of
Technology, by Vasilis Barlakas, Patrick Eriksson and Maryam Jamali.

A summary of the data (names in parenthesis denote the original names
of the habits):

1. Nine habits:

   1). hexagonal column            (single_column)
   2). plate                       (plate)
   3). hollow column               (HC)
   4). droxtal                     (droxtal)
   5). hollow bullet rossette      (HBR)
   6). solid bullet rossette       (SBR)
   7). 8-element column aggregate  (8_columns)
   8). 5-element plate aggregate   (5_plates)
   9). 10-element plate aggregate  (10_plates)

2. Each type of shape has three degrees of roughness: 

   1). smooth           (Rough000)
   2). moderately rough (Rough003)
   3). severely rough   (Rough050)

3. Wavelength range: 
   0.2~15.25 um, 396 wavelengths
   16.4~99.0 um, 49 wavelengths

4. Paricle size range: 
   2.0~10000 um, 189 sizes

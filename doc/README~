------README file for the ice particle database------
This directory contains the single scattering properties
of ice particles assuming various shapes and particle
surface roughness from 0.2 um to 15.25 um and from 16.4 um
to 99.0 um (merged together) in the ARTS xml format. They
correspond to the updated ice single scattering properties
(see [2]).

The scripts that were used to convert Ping Yang's ascii files to these
ARTS xml format are found at https://github.com/vbarl/IRdata

Names in parenthesis denote the original names from the
data given by Yang P.

1. Nine habits:

   1). hexagonal column            (single_column)
   2). plate                       (plate)
   3). hollow column               (HC)
   4). droxtal                     (droxtal)
   5). hollow bullet rossette      (HBR)
   6). solid bullet rossette       (SBR)
   7). 8-element column aggregate  (8_columns)
   8). 5-element plate aggregate   (5_plates)
   9). 10-element plate aggregate  (10_plates).

2. Each type of shape has three degrees of roughness: 

   1). smooth           (Rough000)
   2). moderately rough (Rough003)
   3). severely rough   (Rough050).

3. Wavelength range: 
   0.2~15.25 um, 396 wavelengths; 
   16.4~99.0 um, 49 wavelengths.

4. Paricle size range: 
   2.0~10000 um, 189 sizes.
